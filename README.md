# Fatou_Explorer

An educational GUI package which demonstrates the deterministic behavior of fractals, in particular, the ones produced though iterations of complex-valued functions. Fatou_Explorer allows the user to examine each of the Fatou domains stated in Sullivan's Theorem by providing trajectory traces of requested points through the iterations.

Tested in MATLAB R2006b

## Fatou Domains to Explore

* Attracting
* Super-attracting
* Parabolic (Leau domain)
* Siegel disc
* Herman ring
